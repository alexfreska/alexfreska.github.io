This past Spring I journied out to Malaysia to a small island off the coast called Tioman. Tioman is small and has not been comercialized. It is the home to many beaches that turtles regularly lay their eggs on.

Turtle eggs are a local delecacy so whenever a nest is found it is transplanted closer to the Juara Turtle project so that we may oversee it. Locals often try to get to nests first so that they may sell or eat the eggs. If an effort is not made to ensure new turtles hatch they will go extinct. Nests have become infrequent and the natural survival rate of the 100-200 turles in a nest is already very low - when humans start using all the nests for consumption or sale, the survival rate is suddenly zero.
