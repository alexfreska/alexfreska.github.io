I do the majority of my **web** prototyping and projects with **Nodejs** and **Backbone**. I have started using **React** because of its speed and clarity. I am very interested in **Elixir**, a relative to Erlang that also runs on the ErlangVM. I recently started using **Python** from the NumPy perspective for my **Machine Learning** projects. I study at **Rensselaer**. Please contact me via **Twitter**.
