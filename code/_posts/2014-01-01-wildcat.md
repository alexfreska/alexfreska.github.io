[**Wildcat**][wc] is an innovative Chrome extension for bookmarking. I have never been able to completely adopt any of the existing bookmarking tools on the market. Even the best and most powerful options have always felt too peripheral and as a result I do not remember to consistently use them during browsing.

The core idea of Wildcat is making bookmarking/tagging/curating a very natural part of browsing. The way I tried to achieve this was by creating an overlay that could be opened on any webpage with the press of a hotkey. This keeps your focus on the page as opposed to some button along the top of your bookmarks bar that often goes forgotten (at least in my case :P). Webpages can be tagged from the interface and are saved to Chrome storage or put in bookmark folders created for each tag.

The project is still under development (whenever I have a spare moment from other projects). I have included a screenshot of the overlay. The information displayed is fairly nonsensical test data, as I progress with the project I will dive deeper into the core functionality and my design direction.

The source code will eventually be available [**here**][wc].
