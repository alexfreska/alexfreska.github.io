**<a href="http://bit.ly/1t5jZ0c" target="_blank">Bit Itch</a>** lets you monitor average Bitcoin exchange prices with just the corner
of your eye. The color coded badge updates in real-time letting you know how BTC
is doing without even opening the application! The application lists the current
average of all exchanges over the last day, week, and month. The colors notify
you how the current price compares to these historical averages. The popup shows
more info and historical data displayed on a graph that can be zoomed in for
details. The graph needs a little more work.
