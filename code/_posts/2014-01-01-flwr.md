[**Flwr**][flwr] is a collection of tools aimed at optimizing the creation of flowcharts, diagnostics, and other graph based visualizations. Flwr has two main components: interfaces and templates. Interfaces focus on retrieving user data intuitively and quickly. Templates generate interpretations of the data set they are given.

#### Interfaces
Interfaces streamline node based data entry and build a JSON file using the Flwr markup.

#### Templates
Templates consist of routing algorithms, functionality code, and graphical styling. The existing code associated with the Flwr project along with the standardized markup makes the process of building a template more focused on realizing the actual concept.

#### Markup
The JSON markup consists of a title, nodes, and arrows. Nodes have an 'id', 'data', and a 'type'. Arrows have 'from' and 'to' ids that refer to associated nodes. Currently arrows are generated with an 'isLink' value that denotes a back/forward edge but the team plans to cycle out the usage of this value over the next few weeks.
