SmartWindow was a prototyping project I did with a small team of fellow engineers. The idea was to automate opening and closing windows based on weather conditions such as temperature and humidity. The goal was to harness outside weather conditions to save energy and money heating and cooling homes, especially in the Southern United States. Home air conditioning units have greatly increased the quality of living; however, they consume 15 percent of the U.S.â€™s residential energy. This results in an average of 2 tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere per home (EIA.2013).


Indoor sensors were used to obtain information on the current indoor conditions. Local internet weather data was sourced using IP location. We fitted a casement window with an electric motor that controlled a hand crank. A microcontroller was used to process data, run algorithms, and control the motors. The prototype was only setup with one physical window, but was programmed to work with an entire house.

A fellow student ran a Matlab simulation that showed that more than 25 percent of an average A.C. bill could be saved. These results show that designing a final product for market could interest buyers if installation cost can be brought down to something reasonable.
