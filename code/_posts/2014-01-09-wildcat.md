[**Wildcat**][wc] is an innovative Chrome extension for bookmarking. I have never been able to completely adopt any of the existing bookmarking tools on the market. Even the best and most powerful options felt too peripheral to consistently remember to use during browsing.

The core idea of Wildcat is making bookmarking/tagging/curating a very natural part of browsing. The way I tried to achieve this was by creating an overlay that could be opened on any webpage with the press of a hotkey. This keeps your focus on the page as opposed to some button along the top of your bookmarks bar that often goes forgotten (at least in my case :P). Webpages can be tagged from the interface and are saved to Chrome storage or put in bookmark folders created for each tag.

The project is still under development (whenever I have a spare moment from other projects). Below is a screenshot of the overlay. The information displayed is fairly nonsensical test data, I will get a better screenshot soon!

The source code will eventually be available [**here**][wc].
