Every American in this day and age has an iPhone or a comparable smartphone. Apple has made this the reality, acting as a pioneer of innovation in the past decade. An immense amount of man hours have been put into the design of the iPhone and the complex supply chain necessary to source all material and components. This is an amazing feat and technological achievement for humans, but it does not come without a grave tax on humanity.

To manufacture the circuits of an iPhone many rare earth metals are necessary. One important example is tantalum. Tantalum is used to manufacture modern capacitors that can store a high electric charge. These tantalum capacitors are an integral part to the manufacture of the iPhone. Tantalum is obtained through the refinement of an ore known as coltan, and 80% of the world’s coltan resides in Congo.

Congo is an extremely resource rich country and because of this, throughout history and still today, it is utter chaos. Back in the 1800’s Belgian colonists stripped the country of its vast supply of ivory and rubber, wiping out half of the country’s population in their wake. Then in the 1960’s the United States helped install a corrupt puppet dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, who assisted the United States by supplying them with cobalt, a metal that was highly necessary for cold war fighter jets. Mobutu Sese Seko embezzled somewhere between 4 and 15 billion USD from Congo and created massive unrest and economic instability. The country is now a chaotic mess of armed groups and rebel forces.

Now with the modern tech boom in the western world the price per pound of coltan has skyrocketed from under $25 USD to well over $250 USD. This large potential for money has funded and only made Congo’s violent instability worse. Our beloved technology companies are financially enabling and turning a blind eye to the instability and genocide in Congo. The death toll in Congo since 1998 has exceeded 5 million people. In the North Kivu region of Congo alone 500-700 sexual abuse cases are reported per month, many more likely go unreported, and many more likely happen in other regions. Congolese rebels are well known for rape, and are greatly feared by the people. In addition to these grave numbers of widespread death and rape, the resource rich country remains poor as a result of foreign exploitation. There is no logical way to fix the massive web of problems and violence in Congo due to how intrinsic and permanent the damage has become since its inception centuries ago. In 2009 the United States put in place some auditing and reporting requirements for tracing supply chain and reporting the use of conflict minerals, primarily from the resource rich regions in and around Congo. Hopefully these laws have a positive impact on the severe problems.

When considering the cost of an iPhone we can look at the price tag at the Apple store -$199 out of your pocket with a contract; but the real cost of an iPhone lies back where the raw materials were obtained. If you step back to the iPhone assembly plants and circuit board manufacturers like Foxcon, to the tantalum capacitor manufacturers like Hitachi, to the coltan refinery companies like Cabot, to the ports of Kenya and Tanzania… you end up back in Congo where 5 million people have died and a poor countries has been torn apart, all for your iPhone.

Note: The iPhone is being singled out due to its symbolism and importance in technology of the past decade. Coltan is also used in most other smart phones and laptops.
